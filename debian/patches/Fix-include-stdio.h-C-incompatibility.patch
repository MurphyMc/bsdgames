Subject: [PATCH] Fix include/stdio.h C++ incompatibility

I have seen the following error when building bsdgames with
libncurses6:

In file included from /usr/include/wchar.h:36:0,
                 from /usr/include/curses.h:400,
                 from dab/box.cc:48:
include/stdio.h:38:14: error: conflicting declaration of 'char* fgetln(FILE*, size_t*)' with 'C' linkage
 extern char *fgetln(FILE *stream, size_t *len);
              ^~~~~~
In file included from /usr/include/curses.h:183:0,
                 from dab/box.cc:48:
include/stdio.h:38:14: note: previous declaration with 'C++' linkage
 extern char *fgetln(FILE *stream, size_t *len);
              ^~~~~~
GNUmakefile:298: recipe for target 'dab/box.o' failed

Declaring fgetln as extern "C" fixes this.  The patch has been taken
from the Fedora bsd-games package, see
https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/bsd-games/blob/ac743bec7031199ec6fc09b6eb3760ffcfcfd277/f/bsd-games-2.17-stdio-c++.patch.
